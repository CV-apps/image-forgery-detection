Details of Algorithm:

1) Divide the block into small blocks of 16x16 or 8x8
2) Apply DCT on blocks
3) Extract DCT coefficients of lower frequency by selecting coefficients from 1st square of [W/2,W/2] size
4) Overlap a circle of radius W/2 with origin at center of square, and form vectors of dimension 4 as explained in the paper
5) similarity between feature vectors is calculated
